__Federico Maria Massari / federico.massari@bocconialumni.it__
## Introduction
[Bay Area Bike Share](https://www.fordgobike.com) (now _Ford GoBike_) provides on-demand bike rentals for customers in San Francisco, Redwood City, Palo Alto, Mountain View, and San Jose. Users can unlock bikes from various stations throughout each city, and return them to any station within the same city. Clients pay for the service either through a yearly subscription or by purchasing a 24-hour or 3-day pass. Under service conditions, they can make an unlimited number of trips: trips under thirty minutes in length have no additional charge, longer trips will incur overtime fees.

__Figure 1__ maps all Bay Area Bike Share stations available in the period 8-29-13 (inception date) to 2-28-14.
